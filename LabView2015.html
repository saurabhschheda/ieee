          <div class="content" style="max-width: 100%">
            <p>
				Introduction to Lab view workshop was held on 27 May 2015-1st June 2015 which took place at the computer lab of Telecommunication Engineering (TCE) Dept. in BMSCE.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lab view workshop was a professional body activity, an activity of BMSCE IEEE Student Branch and also an activity of INDUSTRY INSTITUTE INTERACTION CELL (IIIC) with the technical support from National Instruments (NI). The workshop was hosted by the dept. of TCE, lead by Dr. B. Kanmani, Head of the dept. of TCE.
				<br>Organisers of the workshop are Dr. B. Kanmani(TCE), Shreenivas. B(TCE), Prasanna Kumar. M. K(TCE) and Solaikutty Dhanabal(NI).

            </p>
			<p>
				The workshop comprised of five sessions with each session held per day which lasted for 3hrs (10am-1pm). 37 students from various departments attended the workshop. The participants have been given an opportunity to design, prototype and deploy any application as per their choice with the help of lab view and submit it on 1st July 2015. The attendees were also treated to an inspiring talk and an informative presentation by an Industry expert from National Instruments.
				The workshop ended with the distribution of certificate of participation among the participants followed by a photo session.


			</p>
			<p>
				The workshop started with an ice-breaker that required the participants to introduce themselves. The workshop took place for a span of one week and was held only for the 2nd sem students. The objective of the workshop was to introduce lab view software developed by NI to students which is an underpin and also an ideal development environment for innovation, discovery & accelerated results. Dr. B. Kanmani opened the session by giving a brief account of lab view, its necessity and applications in various fields and also established ground rules. <br>
				She then went on to the first session beginning with familiarizing of the Lab view environment and certain basic functions and tools to the students. She started explaining the method of formulating and developing the lab view code for the basic equations such as ohm's law. She laid emphasis on continual writing, complete understanding, simplification of the complexity in circuit design and testing examples in lab view. She further went on teaching students to develop codes for basic equations, development of waveforms, problems involved in mathematics, physics and electronics and also development of basic logical circuits through lab view code.
				The second session laid emphasis on exploring of various other functions and tools, developing of inverting and non-inverting amplifiers, solving mathematical equations using formula node, etc.<br>
				The third session was undertaken by Prof. Shreenivas, dept. of TCE who taught multisim, a simulation software with powerful learning features and laboratory hardware integration, Multisim teaches students foundational concepts in analog, digital, and power electronics used throughout engineering. Multisim simulation and circuit design software gives engineers the advanced analysis and design capabilities to optimize performance, reduce design errors, and shorten time to prototype. Participants were  made to work on the basic designing of different types of oscillators and also logical circuits such as half and full adders and few others.
				The fourth session was designed to elicit the maximum contribution from all the participants, and consisted of three main sections each aiming to promote reflection and deeper exploration of the various libraries of lab view and functions and components of multisim.
			</p>
			<p>
				These three section comprised:<br>
				1. Discussion in break-out groups & clarification of doubts.<br>
				2. Exploring of various libraries which led to continued refinement of participant's knowledge in lab view and multisim.<br>
				3. The individuals took up a problem of their choice and developed a lab view code for the defined problem.
				
			</p>
			<p>
				The fifth session which took place on the last day of the workshop was aimed at giving the attendees an incentive to equip themselves with the help of lab view software to innovate, discover or produce accelerated results. This session was conducted by Solaikutty Dhanabal, academic manager at NI where in his motivational speech and an informative presentation on Internet Of Things, Cyber Physical Systems and Cloud Computing and an insight on the applications of lab view in various fields and also an assurance given by him of supporting attendees in their projects by giving a provision of connecting them with the students at IVY League Schools and also industries was " a shot in arm" for all the participants.

			</p>
			<p>
				Green knowledge signifies progress and outcome where as brown knowledge signifies our theoretical knowledge acquired through rote system of learning. 'Greening the Brown knowledge' represents turning of knowledge into practice and visualizing and analyzing of data and complete understanding of concepts which is made possible with lab view.
