          <div class="content" style="max-width: 100%">
            <p>Samagra 2017 hosted by the Melton Foundation at BMS College of Engineering
                on the 4th and 5th of November, was an international conference, revolving
                around a central theme ‘Integrate, Innovate, Collaborate’. The conference mainly
                focused on sustainability, social innovation, and technology to tackle pressing
                issues locally with the global context in mind.</p>
            <p>The conference featured Spring Board Sessions with six inspiring speakers who
                shared their impact story together with personal accounts from their journey as
                change agents. In five workshop, resourceful facilitators, brought an abundance
                of ideas to share, experiences to recount, and oodles of enthusiasm. In addition to
                the conference giving future change makers a boost in the right direction, it also
                served as a safe-space for creative ideas to flow, without the fear of judgement.</p>
             <p>Rajagopalan, a student of BMS College of Engineering and enthused attendee at
                Samagra 2017, expressed that he found the environment at the conference to be
                lively and wonderful, and that his Workshop Facilitators were very bubbly. He
                said that the workshop ‘Design Thinking for Positive Change’ which he was a
                part of, was constantly abuzz, in turn never letting the participants’ minds stay
                idle. He conveyed that he learned the importance of being open to new ideas,
                while working as a team. He found that the conference helped him gain new
                perspectives and meet new people.</p>
             <p>Another participant, Yusuf, who is a recent graduate from BMS College of
                Engineering, said that the Spring Board sessions were very inspiring, and made
                him want to reevaluate the career path he was choosing for himself. One of the
                workshops he attended was ‘The Future of Work: Building a meaningful and
                global career in the 21st century’, through which he got to explore his career
                options and interact with a diverse set of people. Overall, Yusuf found that he
                was able to express his ideas freely, and that the atmosphere at Samagra was fun and conducive to learning.</p>
              <p>And then there were the other workshops that unpacked strategies and tools for
                green economics, sustainable food production, as well as innovation for
                marginalized communities. All in all, close to 100 young women and men from
                BMSCE and across Bangalore seized the opportunity to explore the converging
                fields of technology, sustainability and social innovation through a
                global citizenship lens.</p>

                global citizenship lens.</p>
              <p>The consensus among the participants was that the conference had surpassed
                their expectations, and that the two days flew by in the blink of an eye!</p>
              <p>When asked what opinion she had about the participants of Samagra 2017, Wen
                Xiaozhuo, a graduate of the Zhejiang University (China), and the facilitator of
                the workshop ‘Sustainable Food Production’, she said that she was deeply
                touched by their enthusiasm and their eagerness to learn from her and, connect
                with her. She expressed that she found more similarities, rather than differences
                between Indians and the Chinese, as a result of which she felt right at home
                during the conference!</p>
              <p>Tito Magero, the facilitator of the workshop ‘Innovation for Marginal
                Communities’, loved the energy every participant, workshop facilitator, and
                Spring board speakers carried with them. He found that no one at the conference
                was solely teaching another, and that everyone had something to learn from
                every individual. He said that not only did he give the participants of his
                workshop an idea of how to innovate in developing countries such as India,
                Ghana and Kenya, but also took away a good chunk of knowledge about the
                innovations taking place in India as well. He said that this would further help
                innovate in his own locality.</p>
              <p>Vaishnavi Sundar, an independent film maker, a feminist and a speaker at
                Samagra Spring board Sessions, conveyed that she found the audience
                responsive and engaging. She said that she found it delightful to see young
                participants appreciating, and nodding along to what she was saying. She
                believed having people belonging to various many different cultures, in one
                place, opened up pathways to new perspectives and ideas. She expressed that a
                part of her wishes that she was a student at BMSCE, getting to witness Samagra
                2017!</p>
              <p>Before concluding the conference on the evening of November 5th, participants
                had the space and opportunity to come up with own ideas on how to tackle
                pressing issues during ‘Connecting the Dots’. They formed groups based on their
                area of interests and pooled in all the knowledge they had gathered over the
                course of the two days. One of the teams came up with an idea to create an appthat can flag and tackle online psychological abuse, while another passionate
                group of people formulated ideas to help solve the issues children face all over
                the world, in order to ensure a better upbringing. Another enthusiastic team
                came up with solutions to make communities across the world more sustainable
                through simple means such as efficient garbage disposal methods.</p>
              <p>Thus, by forming these project groups, Samagra 2017 served as an impetus for
                sustainable, social change in the issues experienced at a global scale. Overall, all
                the participants, Workshop Facilitators and Spring Board speakers found
                Samagra 2017 to be deeply enriching, insightful and a whole lot of fun!</p>
